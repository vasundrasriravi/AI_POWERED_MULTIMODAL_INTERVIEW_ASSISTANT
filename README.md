# AI-Powered Multimodal Interview Assistant

A virtual interview platform that evaluates candidates using text, audio, and video analysis to measure communication quality, confidence, and technical accuracy—offering a realistic AI-driven interview preparation experience.

## About
The **AI-Powered Multimodal Interview Assistant** overcomes the limitations of traditional mock interview tools that rely only on text-based responses.  
This system analyzes **spoken language, facial expressions, and textual content** to provide deeper, more accurate evaluation.
